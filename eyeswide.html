            <h3>Passion project</h3>
            <p>Along with the horror genre, Kubrick has always told me that he has wanted to work on a project that dealt with sexual relations, secret societies and the occult. This ended up being a perfect fit to the novel, <i>Dream Story</i>.</p>
            <p>Although he had a love affair with other projects he worked on, I never saw him more devoted to this one. He meticulously created his vision and was extremely proud of how the shooting turned out. Unfortunately, due to the strong content, his producers made rigorous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes_Wide_Shut#Controversies">last-minute edits and cut scenes</a> that compromised its realistic aesthetic. This (in part) led to mixed reactions from fans and critics after the film was released.</p>

            <p>I could see that Stanley was visibly deteriorating and needed medical attention. However, he didn't want to stop working and eventually the stress and problems caught up to him.</p>
