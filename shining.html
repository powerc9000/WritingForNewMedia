            <h3>His favorite human emotion</h3>
            <p>Kubrick was in his best element when he was hard at work on a project that he felt emotionally invested and fully involved in. So when it came to shooting his horror piece, The Shining, he was overly expressive about his enthusiasm to the project.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, as the shoot progressed, he started having recurring guilt plague him about <a href="moon.html">the government's top secret project</a></p>
            <br>
            <h3>Acting perfectionism</h3>

            <p>Progressively into the film's shoot Stanley's attitude was starting to turn sour and unfortunately actors/actresses were feeling the brunt. The lead actress in The Shining, named Shelly Duvall, was <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/interview-with-shelley-duvall#Primal">forced to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, 5-6 days a week for about 9 months</a>.</p>
            <p>This propigated into his later films as he had to have the perfect performance for each and every one of his scenes. Many times, he would take up to 100 takes to get just the right emotion out of his actor/actress.</p>

            <h3>Spotlight: soundtrack</h3> 
            <p>Kubrick would listen to music all day long in every imaginable genre when searching for music to put in his films. In one such case, it took him 42 days just to score one scene in his film, Barry Lyndon. In this film, he focused on a more unnerving and psychological soundtrack for maximal effectiveness</p>
