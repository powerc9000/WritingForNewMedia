          <h3>Birth of a professional relationship</h3>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve always been drawn to the cinema. Ever since I was a young girl my father would take me to see double features every month. This obsession continued into my adult life as I was always up-to-date on what’s going on in the filmmaking world.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Window of '63, when I had just turned twenty, I had the opportunity of a lifetime when I applied for an internship as a director's assistant. I didn’t think much of this job prospect since applications in the movie business usually didn’t garner much attention, but to my surprise, I received a callback. It was a job offer to be the personal assistant of the up-and-coming director by the name of Stanley Kubrick, who was just finishing up his shoot of his Cold War satire: Dr. Strangelove. His secretary mentioned that he’d like to meet me in London and offered to fly me out. I was ecstatic and boarded a plane at the LAX the next day.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting Kubrick was a surreal experience. I wasn’t very familiar with his accomplishments as a director/writer, but I knew that he had talent. He spoke volumes about his character when he would go off about every meticulous detail that he managed in his recent shoot. It was clear to me that he wanted to have full control of every aspect of his projects.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ended up talking for hours about our favorite films and mutual fascination with the horror genre. Our conversations were very cordial and he offered me a job on the spot when our time together ended. Without any hesitation, I accepted.</p>
