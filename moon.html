            <h3>A massive hoax</h3> 
            <p>Kubrick was taken by government officials for what felt like a millenia. When released, he informed me that he swore an oath of secrecy not to mention what he was tasked to do. Regardless of this (and probably out of spite), he told me that he was being forced to film and stage a fake moon landing. Apparently, the Russians were getting incredibly close to having a successful launch and in order to sustain patriotism in the minds of American citizens, the U.S. had to beat them in the race. He had declined to work on the project since it was immoral and retrogressive, but they threatened him and his family. It was a little over 9 months before I saw him again and when I did, he was a changed man.</p>

                <p>While filming his horror film, The Shining, Kubrick was feeling the height of his emotional guilt for working on the project.</p>

            <p>So, in lieu of the U.S. government, Stanley used film as his outlet to confess what he'd done to the general public. In The Shining, he started peppering the shoot with ways of conveying this information to the point where Stephen King, who wrote the book and unaware of his secret, started getting irritated with his work.</p>
