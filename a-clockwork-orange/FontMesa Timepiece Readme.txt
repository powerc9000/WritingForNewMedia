	Timepiece is a font based on the logo from the movie A Clockwork Orange®
	a Warner Bros Trademark.

	Timepiece includes two fonts, the first Timepiece font is the basic lettering
	and the second font Timepiece 3D Backfill is designed to be placed behind the
	first Timepiece font to give the illusion of depth to the letters. This could
	have been accomplished in one font by creating an open faced font with the 3D
	extension off to one side but with an open faced font you can't overlap a
	characters spacing without one character showing through the other one next to it.
	To further create the 3d illusion the characters should overlap slightly over
	the letter next to it, so it was much easier to create two solid fonts that you 
	could layer in any position you like giving you the 3D illusion within a 2 dimensional
	image or piece of paper. 


 HOW FILL FONTS WORK:
      

      	Fill fonts are created to fill in the hollow space within outline fonts
      	to prevent the background from showing through the font.
     	Fill fonts are usually slightly smaller than the fonts outline
      	but may also be oversized to create a border behind and around the font
      	to help separate it from a background image. Another application for fill
      	fonts would be to add decorations to the top layer of a font.
      
      	Fill fonts can only be used within applications that allow multiple
      	layers within the work area so fill fonts wouldn't work in programs
      	such as word processors like MS Word or Wordpad.
      
      	Fill fonts may not work with all applications in Windows, some
      	fonts have characters that extend outside it's em-square, although
      	the font may have been generated to allow it to display outside
      	of this boundary display problems may occur within some applications.
      	In some applications alignment problems may occur with the fill font in
      	relation to the font(s) layered above or below it, some fill fonts have
      	characters that are located to the right or left of that fonts basepoint, 
      	some applications don't recognize the left side bearing of a font set by
      	its basepoint as part of that fonts spacing and will shift the fill fonts 
      	character spacing to the left side of the characters outline and cause a 
      	misalignment to happen. The only solution around this problem is to use
      	a different program for your design work, Adobe Photoshop6 , Adobe 
      	Illustrator8, Adobe ImageStyler, and Paintshop Pro 7 all work well with 
      	fill fonts.
      
      	To use fill fonts simply type the text using the first font as the base 
      	then select the next font style and add the same text on top the base font,
      	then repeat the same with any decoration fills adding different colors
      	and textures to each font.
