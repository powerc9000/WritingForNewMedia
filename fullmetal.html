            <h3>High tensions</h3>
            <p>Kubrick's next project, Full Metal Jacket was his forray into the Vietnam war. While this has been done by other directors prior, part of his emphasis was on the psychological trauma enduced at boot camp.</p>
            <p>Throughout the filmâ€™s shoot, I noticed a lot of tension between Kubrick and his film crew. Either he was overworking them on a daily basis, or they were trying to take advantage of the repetitive shooting schedule. The persistent turmoil reached a boiling point when he got so irritated with crew members that he would simply have me relay messages back and forth to avoid any further interaction.</p>

            <h3>Spotlight: attention to detail</h3> 
            <p>Due to the fear of flying, Kubrick decided to shoot the entire film in England which meant he had to re-create urban Vietnamese city streets and folliage.</p>

              <br>
                <p>When Full Metal Jacket was being filmed in England a whole plastic replica Vietnamese jungle was air-freighted in from California, so I was assured. Next morning Stanley walked on set, took one look at it, and said, "I don't like it. Get rid of it." The technicians shared out the trees, giving a new look to gardens in North London, and a real jungle was delivered instead, palm trees uprooted from Spain.</p>
